# CSCI4830FinalProject
This is the final project for the CU Boulder Machine Learning Class.

We wanted to build a model that would test how much karma a reddit comment would recieve in the reddit.com/r/pics subreddit. This repo contains all relevant files.

## SVM Instructions
To run the SVMs, navigate to 'CSCI4830FinalProject/SVM/'.
