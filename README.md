# CSCI4830FinalProject
This is the final project for the CU Boulder Machine Learning Class.

We wanted to build a model that would test how much karma a reddit comment would recieve in the reddit.com/r/pics subreddit. This repo contains all relevant files.

## SVM Instructions
To run the SVMs, navigate to 'CSCI4830FinalProject/SVM/'.
To run the binary classifier run:
    python svm.py
To run the multiclass classifier run:
    python multiclass_svm.py

## Feature Extraction
To generate the unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams navigate to 'CSCI4830FinalProject/Feature\_Extraction/scripts'
